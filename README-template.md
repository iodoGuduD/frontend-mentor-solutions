## Overview
- Fazia muito tempo que eu estava estudando HTML e CSS, por√©m nunca conseguia encontrar uma maneira interessante e completa de treinar projetos nessas linguagens. Achei o Frontend Mentor e aqui estamos. Foi muito bom construir esse projeto, pois ele tinha um objetivo e um molde para ser criado.
- N√£o queria estudar design para entender como montar uma estrutura de site bonita, intuitiva, funcional, etc. tudo que um UX precisa, porque n√£o tenho tanto tempo para dividir na √°rea de programa√ß√£o e UX.
- Foi bom relembrar alguns conceitos e descobrir novas t√©cnicas simples para resolu√ß√£o de problemas b√°sicos que sempre s√£o encontrados na vida de um desenvolvedor web.
- Boa leitura e obrigado pela mesma!

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
